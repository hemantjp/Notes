dangling: within a function call a local(not static) variable defined and its address returned ..due to context lost when function returns the pointer points to garbage
null: points to zero.. this is a c macro
void:It's good for dealing with blocks of data without regards to type. This is necessary for things like memory allocation, copying, file operations, and passing pointers-to-functions
